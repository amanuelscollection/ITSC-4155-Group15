# READ BEFORE RUNNING:
Make sure you have node.js installed correctly.

Make sure to download the neccessary dependencies for the webpage using the "npm install" command in the terminal.

After the dependencies are installed, run the "npm nodemon server" or "npx nodemon server" command in the terminal to start the webpage.

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser to access the home page.

(We reccomend using the built in terminal in vs code).
